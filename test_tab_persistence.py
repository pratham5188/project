ðŸŽ¯ PROBLEM SOLVED:
Before: Any action caused app to refresh and return to "AI Predictions" tab
After:  App remembers your current tab and stays there after refresh

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
âœ… Added 'active_tab' to st.session_state
âœ… Replaced st.tabs() with st.radio() for persistence
âœ… Conditional rendering based on selected tab
âœ… Beautiful CSS styling for tab-like appearance
âœ… Maintains all existing functionality

ðŸŽ¨ USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
âœ… Stay on current tab after any action
âœ… Responsive tab navigation with hover effects
âœ… Neon green theme matching app design
âœ… Smooth transitions and visual feedback
âœ… No interruption to workflow

ðŸ“‹ HOW IT WORKS:

1. SESSION STATE MANAGEMENT:
   â€¢ st.session_state.active_tab stores current tab index
   â€¢ Persists across all app refreshes and actions

2. RADIO BUTTON NAVIGATION:
   â€¢ Horizontal radio buttons styled as tabs
   â€¢ Updates session state when changed
   â€¢ Renders content conditionally

3. CONDITIONAL RENDERING:
   â€¢ if/elif structure replaces tab containers
   â€¢ Same content, better state management
   â€¢ All existing features preserved

ðŸš€ TESTING SCENARIOS:

Scenario 1: Working in Portfolio Tracker
âœ… Before: Action â†’ Refresh â†’ Back to AI Predictions
âœ… After:  Action â†’ Refresh â†’ Stay in Portfolio Tracker

Scenario 2: Analyzing in Advanced Analytics  
âœ… Before: Change stock â†’ Refresh â†’ Back to AI Predictions
âœ… After:  Change stock â†’ Refresh â†’ Stay in Advanced Analytics

Scenario 3: Reading News & Sentiment
âœ… Before: Any interaction â†’ Refresh â†’ Back to AI Predictions  
âœ… After:  Any interaction â†’ Refresh â†’ Stay in News & Sentiment

Scenario 4: Using Advanced Tools
âœ… Before: Discovery check â†’ Refresh â†’ Back to AI Predictions
âœ… After:  Discovery check â†’ Refresh â†’ Stay in Advanced Tools
